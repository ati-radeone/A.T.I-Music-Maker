# A.T.I-Music-Maker
School exam project

This is an initial music writer desktop application.

A.T.I Music Maker is a desktop application built on the (Electron framework, express, Tone.js, Sqlite3) stack for my exam in 2020. I worked on it for 3 months. It has two surfaces. The user must register when starting the program. This way, as soon as the application redirects to the editing interface, we can save our projects under our own name.Currently, one instrument can be selected. A starting drum interface is also available. You have a sequencer interface for entering sounds. This can be recorded using the mouse or keyboard. The sounds are saved in a database so that we can call the saved project again later.
